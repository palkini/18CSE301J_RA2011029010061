  <h1>D3 Visualisation</h1>
  <p>ABOUT D3
    <br>
    D3 (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library used for data visualization on the web. It provides a set of tools for manipulating HTML and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) documents based on data. With D3, developers can create dynamic and interactive visualizations that respond to user interactions and changes in data.

D3 allows developers to work with data at a low level, giving them fine-grained control over the visual elements of a chart or graph. This means that developers can create custom visualizations that are tailored to their specific needs, rather than relying on pre-built chart libraries with limited options for customization.

D3 also supports a variety of data formats, including CSV, JSON, and TSV, and provides a range of built-in data processing functions for manipulating and transforming data.

While D3 has a steeper learning curve than some other data visualization libraries, its flexibility and power make it a popular choice for creating complex and customized visualizations on the web. Some examples of D3 visualizations include interactive maps, scatterplots, and network diagrams.

  <p>ABOUT OBSERVABLE
    <br>Observable HQ is a web-based platform that allows users to create and share interactive data visualizations, animations, and simulations. It is built on top of the D3.js library, which is a powerful tool for data visualization in web applications.

    One of the main features of Observable HQ is the notebook-style interface, which allows users to write and run code in real-time, and see the results of their changes immediately. Users can create notebooks from scratch or use pre-built templates, and can also import and export data from a variety of sources.
    
    Observable HQ provides a wide range of built-in visualization tools, including bar charts, scatterplots, and line charts, as well as more advanced tools such as force-directed graphs and interactive maps. These tools are highly customizable, allowing users to adjust colors, fonts, and other visual elements to create a unique and compelling visualization.
    
    Observable HQ also has a strong community of users, who share their notebooks and collaborate on projects through a variety of built-in tools, such as commenting and version control. This makes it a valuable resource for data analysts, researchers, and educators looking to share and collaborate on data-driven projects.

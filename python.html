  <h1>Python in Data Visualisation</h1>
  <p>ROLE OF PYTHON IN DATA VISUALISATION
    <br>
    Python is a popular programming language used in data analysis and visualization due to its flexibility and vast array of libraries and tools. Python's visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh, provide a range of options for creating static and interactive visualizations.

One of the benefits of using Python for data visualization is its ability to handle large datasets and complex data structures. Python's data manipulation libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy, allow users to clean and preprocess data before creating visualizations.

Python also enables users to create custom visualizations and interactive dashboards through the use of web frameworks like Flask and Django. These frameworks can be used to create dynamic and responsive web-based data visualizations that can be easily shared and accessed by others.

Additionally, Python's integration with Jupyter Notebooks allows users to create dynamic reports and presentations that combine code, visualizations, and narrative text, making it an ideal tool for data storytelling.

Overall, Python's versatility and extensive library ecosystem make it a valuable tool for data visualization, enabling users to create sophisticated and interactive visualizations from complex data.

  <p>PYTHON WORDCLOUD
    <br>
    A Python word cloud is a data visualization technique that creates an image of words from a given text or dataset. The size of each word in the image is proportional to its frequency in the text, with more frequent words appearing larger in size and less frequent words appearing smaller. Python has several libraries available for creating word clouds, including wordcloud, matplotlib, and seaborn. These libraries provide a range of customization options for the appearance and content of the word cloud, such as setting the color scheme, font, and background color, as well as excluding or including certain words based on specific criteria. Word clouds are commonly used in fields such as data science, journalism, and social media analysis to quickly visualize and communicate the most common words in a given text or dataset.
